I'm a PhD student in the Persson Group in Materials Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My primary interests are in developing machine learning methods for the analysis of quantum chemical calculations. I am currently focused on manipulating deep learning frameworks to better understand the precise structures of zeolites. I am also interested statistical frameworks for analyzing messy experimental data to derive as much information as possible from imperfect measurements.
